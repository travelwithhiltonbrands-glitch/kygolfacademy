    "content": "Grip is the most important fundamental. It largely determines whether the ball goes right, left, or straight. Grip pressure should feel like holding a bird: not so hard you harm it, not so soft it escapes. Visual check: when you look down after gripping, you should see about 2.5 knuckles on each hand. Grip position on the handle affects distance and control: hold at the very end of the grip to maximize distance; hold in the middle to lose ~5–10 yards but gain control; choke down closer to the shaft for shorter, more controlled distance."
